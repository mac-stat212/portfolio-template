title: "Pre-Class Leanings"

This section contains the pre-class learnings.


## Instructions

Save the summaries (mind map images and notes) for pre-class learnings in this folder. When adding a file, name it as `MMDD-short_title.png`, where `MM` is the month and `DD` is the day of the lesson. For instance, a mind map for the 'Files' lesson that will be covered on August 2nd would be named `0802-files.jpg`. To show all your images in one place, follow the example shown in the `pcl.qmd` file.
