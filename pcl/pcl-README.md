Save pre-class learning summaries—such as mind map images and notes—in this folder. When adding a file, name it as `MMDD-short_title.png`, where `MM` is the month and `DD` is the day of the lesson. For instance, a mind map for the 'Files' lesson that will **be** covered on August 2nd would be named `0802-files.jpg`. To show all your images in one place, follow the example shown in the `pcl.md` file.
